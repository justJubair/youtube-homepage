            <div>
                <h3 class="text-2xl text-gray-500 font-semibold">1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.</h3>
                <p class="my-4">
                <span class="font-bold">Var:</span> It’s globally scoped and variables which are declared with var are hoisted but the values are not hoisted. The variables which are declared with var those can be re-declared and reassign which can to errors in code. <br>
                <span class="font-bold">Let:</span> It’s block scoped, you can’t re-declared a variable which is declared with let. you can reassign their values. let variables are also hoisted to the top of their block scope. <br>
                <span class="font-bold">Const:</span> It’s also block scoped. you can’t re-declare and reassign a variable which is declared with const. But you change the element of objects and arrays even if they are declared with const.
                </p>
            </div>
            <!-- question two -->
            <div>
                <h3 class="text-2xl text-gray-500 font-semibold">2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined.</h3>
                <p class="my-4"><span class="font-bold">Undefined:</span> When a variable is declared with var or let but not assigned to any specific value then it’s indicates by undefined. And it’s also the default value of a function when there’s no return statement. <br>
                <span class="font-bold">Null:</span> It’s indicates no value. null is usually assigned to a variable that should have no value. We can use null to clear the value of an object of variable.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- question three -->
            <div>
                <h3 class="text-2xl text-gray-500 font-semibold">3. What do you mean by REST API?</h3>
                <p class="my-4"><span class="font-bold">REST</span> api stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It’s a way to communicate with the HTTP protocol. It’s a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.</p>
